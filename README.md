# ImPART Target Trial
IMproving Prophylactic Antibiotic use for Recurrent urinary Tract infection (IMPART) - target trial emulation

## üìù Project Description

A retrospective cohort study designed using the Comparative Effectiveness Research Based on Observational Data to Emulate a Target Trial (CERBOT) tool, to emulate a pragmatic clinical trial assessing the effect of prophylactic antibiotic initiation versus usual care on subsequent antibiotic resistance.

The objective of this research is to estimate the effect of prophylactic antibiotic use on antibiotic resistance in women with recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs).
